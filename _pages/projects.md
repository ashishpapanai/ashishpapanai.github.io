# Projects

## Major Projects

### AIDE - Artificial Intelligence Guide for Visually Impaired
**Description**: Developed AIDE (An audio guide for visually impaired persons navigation and assistance). The project is an improved implementation of YOLO v3 Algorithm for object detection and classification and Canny's Edge detection algorithm for lane detection and navigation.

**Technologies**: Python, OpenCV, YOLO v3, Computer Vision, Edge Detection

### STOCKDL - Efficient Prediction of Annual Yield from Stocks Using Hybrid Deep Learning
**Description**: A financial deep learning library for stocks price prediction and comparison with traditional investment strategies. The Library is based on LSTM-Neural Networks and Conv1D + LSTM Neural Networks.

**Technologies**: Python, TensorFlow, LSTM, Conv1D, Financial Analysis

### IMGPROVE - Image Super-Resolution
**Description**: Developed deep-learning solution to improve the quality of low-resolution images. This API improves the resolution of a 100x100 image to 400x400. Also helpful in optimizing data storage in cloud based servers without compromising much with the quality of the image.

**Technologies**: Python, Deep Learning, Image Processing, API Development

## Team Projects

### AGNI: Advanced Guard for Navigating Internet
**Description**: Developed as Major Project (Thesis Project) for Bachelor of Technology (CSE). A custom client safe browser with obscenity blocking in images using computer vision algorithms and deep neural networks (MobileNet), and Obscenity blocking in texts using Bert Classifier. To enable obscenity blocking in Videos, we employed Video summarisation techniques to extract keyframes, and check for obscenity based on the response from the image model.

**Technologies**: Computer Vision, MobileNet, BERT, Video Processing, Web Development

### VIHANCED: Video Super Resolution for Edge Devices
**Description**: Developed as Minor Project for Bachelor of Technology (CSE). Published in DELCON 2023.

**Technologies**: Video Processing, Edge Computing, Deep Learning

### Mallaca Trade: Fostering Singapore-India Trade using AI and BlockChain
**Description**: OCR to digitize the forms issued by ACRA (Singapore) and Ministry of MSME (India). BlockChain-based smart contracts to facilitate trust between the partners, and for legal implications.

**Technologies**: OCR, Blockchain, Smart Contracts, AI

### Re-Energise
**Description**: Roof top area calculation from satellite images, to calculate energy savings by painting roofs with a more reflective color.

**Technologies**: Satellite Image Processing, Computer Vision, Energy Analysis

### Sangmanch
**Description**: Automated portal for internal co-ordinations between Indian Council for Cultural Centres, and Indian Cultural Centres abroad.

**Technologies**: Web Development, Automation, Database Management
