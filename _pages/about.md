*University of Tübingen*  
*ELIZA Master's Scholarship Recipient* -->

<!-- ## Overview -->

I am an incoming MSc Machine Learning student at the University of Tübingen, selected for the prestigious ELIZA Master’s Scholarship. Previously, I worked as an Associate ML Scientist - 2 at the Wadhwani Institute for Artificial Intelligence, where I specialized in computer vision and agricultural AI applications. My research aims to develop innovative solutions for crop monitoring, pest detection, and yield estimation using advanced deep learning techniques, building on my extensive experience in computer vision, model optimization, and deploying AI systems in real-world agricultural applications.

I am driven by a commitment to developing human-centric, reliable, and ethical AI systems, always striving to leverage technology for significant social impact. My work has consistently aimed to translate complex data and algorithmic patterns into practical tools for real-world challenges. My professional background highlights my dedication to creating impactful AI solutions across diverse domains.

Building on my hands-on experience in the foundations of machine learning, particularly in computer vision and deep learning, I am now focused on further contributing to the field. My projects have involved developing advanced medical AI solutions, such as a Gall Bladder Cancer detection system, and notably, contributing to the large-scale agricultural AI deployment of the CottonAce system for crop monitoring, where I played a key role in its national implementation. I am also actively working to apply my experience in optimizing machine learning pipelines for efficient model deployment and exploring principles of building robust AI systems, including research on uncertainty-aware inference.

My core research interests involve actively advancing explainable AI (XAI) and developing efficient models for edge deployment. I am focused on bridging the gap between theoretical AI advancements and their practical implementation, aiming to continually enhance the interpretability and performance of real-world AI applications. My objective is to continue delivering high-impact AI solutions, particularly within medicine, life sciences, and agricultural technologies.
